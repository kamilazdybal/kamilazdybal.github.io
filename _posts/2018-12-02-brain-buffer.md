# On data buffers and remembering dreams

Here are two events:

1. Some time ago my old laptop started to go slightly crazy. I would turn it on and once the system was loaded, for a short period of time the screen would show pieces of windows or images from the previous time when it was on. Probably the graphical card was damaged? Perhaps it had data from the previous session saved in the buffer and with the new session it was spitting it out.

2. I usually remember my dreams, roughly. Not every scene, but I can usually say at least one sentence about what I have dreamt about last night. Since some time, when I go to bed at night, shortly before falling asleep but when I'm still conscious, a vivid image from the dream I had the previous night shows up. This doesn't happen during daytime, only in this state shortly before falling asleep.

Obviously these two events appeared alike to me one day. Could the same thing be happening in the brain as was happening to my laptop? Could it be that the brain saves the dream data in a region which is not accessible in a fully awake daytime but once our brain shifts to almost falling asleep, this brain region is accessible again?
