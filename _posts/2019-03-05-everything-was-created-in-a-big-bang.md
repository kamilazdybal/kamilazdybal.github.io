# Everything was created in a Big Bang

Two-dimensional plane of an immense density started to expand in an exponential rate. The Universe increased its volume, creating new space and maintaining a constant amount of matter inside. During the enormous inflation, the primordial plasma of tiny irregularities started to arrange itself into distinguishable collections of matter.

Smaller object were first created, which expanded, forming larger Galaxies.

In one of the Galaxies, a form of life came to be. At first, it didnâ€™t knew much about the surrounding Universe. But soon the observers discovered electricity and magnetism. They described the theory of gravitational interaction. They saw light as both particles and waves. They noticed protons and neutrinos. Microwave background radiation and redshift.

Inflation of the Universe was visibly slowing down. Galaxies moved away from each other much slower. The formed objects burned and cooled. The last elements exploded in clouds of dust and gas.

Astronomers would have known what it means but there were no more astronomers, observers, neither any form of life in the Universe.

And then, the Universe stopped.

Galaxies were standing still.

-Biip-biip - said the microwave. Popcorn was ready.
