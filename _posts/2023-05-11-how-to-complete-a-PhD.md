# How to complete a Ph.D.

Doing a Ph.D. has been an immensely rewarding journey for me. It has been really difficult at times, and I mean sobbing-at-my-desk difficult. And at other times, I felt like conquering the top of the world! I'm grateful for every experience from my Ph.D., those experiences taught me so much, made me more resilient and more confident. This note is a collection of items that helped me complete my Ph.D. and thrive in a Ph.D. program.
I'm sharing those with you, in hopes that they will help you complete your own journey! You absolutely can end your Ph.D. with a smile on your face and a great sense of accomplishment!

**1. Ask questions. Early and often.** Let's face the tough truth: when you start your Ph.D., you know close to nothing about doing research, or about your research discipline :-) That's normal and expected! But you're going to have to grow during your Ph.D. And in order to grow you're going to have to convey to your advisor what is it that you don't know or don't understand. So, ask questions, early and often. I learned this the hard way. During the first year of my Ph.D., I was so scared that my advisors find out how much I don't know that I was deliberately avoiding asking questions and sometimes even avoiding speaking to my advisors altogether. Only at some point I realized that the only way that I can learn to do good research is if I explicitly tell my advisors: hey, I don't understand that, could you teach me? And you know what? My advisors were entirely okay with teaching me things! Did I sometimes ask them undergraduate-level stuff that I should have know by now? Yes. Did they think in their minds: *Wow, she really should have known that by now!* I don't know, probably yes! Did whatever they thought in their minds have any negative effect on the outside world? Not at all! They were still happy to meet with me and help me out. That was the only way for our research to move forward. So, don't be scared of your advisor, their job is to lift your abilities. The more open you are with them on what you're struggling with, the more efficient their help will be. And sometimes you'll find that that question you feel embarrassed to ask is actually one of the unknowns of your research that even your advisor doesn't yet know the answer to!

**2. Set up weekly meetings with your advisor.** I consider weekly meetings with one of my advisors the biggest contributor to the successful completion of my Ph.D. So many times just the pure act of speaking my current research struggles out-loud to my advisor helped me gain clarity on the path to take next, or helped me shape my way of thinking about a problem. Sometimes thanks to our weekly discussion it became clear to me how to write a section in our paper explaining our results. A weekly meeting keeps up the momentum of your work and holds you accountable. It's also a big motivating factor! There were times when I felt slumps in my motivation and felt like slacking off, but realized that I can't come to the meeting empty-handed. Having that meeting looming over kept pushing me towards completing tasks and doing the necessary analysis despite the lack of motivation.

Two research-related things that you should aim to take out from every meeting are:

1. Resolution of any uncertainties, difficulties, queries. Your advisor should be able to provide direction whenever problems arise.
2. Clarity on what needs to be done next (in the days that follow). If after the meeting you feel energized to tackle the next task, it means the meeting was effective!

But there's more than that. A chance to have a weekly meeting with a brilliant academic is also a wonderful privilege! Imagine you're getting an hour a week of one-on-one, free chat with a real scientist, how cool is that!? You can ask them all sorts of interesting questions and brainstorm research ideas. You will profit enormously from observing the way of thinking of a more senior academic. So, schedule a regular meeting time with your advisor at the very beginning of your Ph.D. and stick to it.

**3. Understand that your advisor is busy and act accordingly.** Your advisor is likely juggling a few research projects at a time, teaching responsibilities, travel, giving talks, and any management or service that the university requires from them. And on top of that, they're trying to have a life and spend time with their family (your advisor is a human too!). Your advisor still cares for you and has your best interest in mind. They just might not have the capacity to help you immediately, and often will need you to help them to help you. Let me give you some examples.

- Your advisor will be forgetful. Therefore:
    - Stay organized with your results and ideas so that they can easily be retrieved and recalled.
    - Come prepared to your weekly meetings. Plan to spend the first 5 minutes of the meeting to remind your advisor where you've left off the previous week. Have a list of items to discuss during the meeting. During the meeting, take notes on what needs to be done.
    - Stay organized with important deadlines. Deadlines for conference submissions, returning rebuttals, or university re-enrollments shouldn't be your advisor's responsibility.
- Your advisor will struggle to reply to your messages/emails. Therefore:
    - Shorten your email messages to the necessary minimum.
    - Whenever possible, aim to send short messages asking for a very specific feedback. Instead of sending a 10-page paper asking for comments, take a screenshot of a specific result and ask: do you think with this result I can make a claim in the paper that ... ?
    - Don't contact your advisor during weekends, or holidays. They have the right to take time off and spend time with their families too!

The important thing is that you understand that when you don't hear back from your advisor, *it's not about you* -- it's about how demanding academic job is nowadays.

**4. Take initiative. Be proactive.** This point largely links with the previous one. You need to take responsibility for your research project. Instead of waiting for your advisor to tell you: *Hey, how about we write a paper on XYZ?*, monitor your results and find possible venues where you might want to send them to at some point. Discuss those paper ideas with your advisor. Suggest a sketch for the first draft. Instead of waiting for the next weekly meeting to hear your advisor suggest the next checks to be performed, try to think if there's any extra checks that you could do that would be helpful for you and your advisor to gain more understanding. As you progress in your Ph.D., you'll find that more often you're able to take good decisions on what needs to be checked next! Remember that it's your Ph.D. and you are at the driver seat of your research. You largely get to decide where you research takes you!

**5. Write regularly.** As academics, part of our job is to disseminate our research. There would be no point in making a new discovery if no one ever finds our about it, right? Writing for an audience is therefore carved in our job description. Throughout your Ph.D., you're going to have to learn academic writing. You're not expected to be good at it at the start, but, like with every other skill, you're going to be making progress in it. The only way to learn writing is to write. As you write more, you'll start getting better at it. Schedule time to write regularly. It can be one paragraph for your next paper describing your current results. It can be one paragraph describing theory for your dissertation. It can be an abstract idea for the next conference. Write throughout your Ph.D. and learn the rules of good academic writing. A helpful resource could be [this Notion page](https://kamilazdybal.notion.site/Improving-your-academic-writing-42da2498f8f14e3a9c9e20a068cbe472) where I collected many guidelines on improving your academic writing.

**6. Learn to make effective visuals.**


**7. Understand that once you get into the unknowns of research, even your advisor doesn't have all the answers.** Sometimes, you're going to have to spend time to check, debug, and test things, so that both you and your advisor learns the answer to a particular question. There is no way around it. Doing research is doing what no one has done yet. The purpose of your Ph.D. is to produce new knowledge.

**8. Schedule time for thought work.**

**9. Take breaks.** Some of my most precious research ideas, or solutions to coding problems that I was tackling happened to me while I was away from my desk and enjoying a run in the forest or a long meditation.


**10. Accept that some days, or even some weeks will be unproductive. And that's alright.**


**11. Prioritize your growth.**


**12. Write code to automate your work.** Your future-self will thank you for any automation that you did today. I usually find that the time spend to write a Python script to automate a task saves me ten times more time later.

Say you need to run a post-processing tool after you collect files with some results. Say that your results files arrive incrementally as you decide to test new scenarios. You can manually check if a given scenario has finished running and then run your post-processing tool. Or, you can parameterize your cases and automatically check if a results file for a given case is already there (the Python way: `os.path.exists()`) and if yes, run the post-processing, if not, just keep going to the next case. You can run such script once a day, and that's all you need to do from now on!

The same thing goes with other dull tasks such as renaming many files, organizing files, running various scenarios, generating figures. It's worth spending time at the beginning of your Ph.D. to learn how to do those things (e.g., in Python). Learn basic operation on files (creating, renaming, saving, moving), learn operation on strings (regular expressions), and learn list comprehensions. For example, say you need to generate a header for a LaTeX table that says *Case-#* where # is an even number from 2 to 20. With this list comprehension in Python:

```python
' & '.join(['Case-' + str(i) for i in range(1,21) if i%2==0])
```

you'll get:

```
Case-2 & Case-4 & Case-6 & Case-8 & Case-10 & Case-12 & Case-14 & Case-16 & Case-18 & Case-20
```

that you can copy and paste into your LaTeX file!

### My last two cents

Remember that no Ph.D. student is a perfect student, and also no advisor is a perfect advisor! Accept that you'll make mistakes or fall behind, and accept that other times your advisor will make mistakes or fall behind. But there's many things that you have control over in your Ph.D. journey. You can improve your experience enormously with a set of ideas that I gathered here.

Good luck!
