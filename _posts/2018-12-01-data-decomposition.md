# Data decomposition

I can appreciate the process of data decomposition in a philosophical sense. Isn't it like finding ghosts hidden behind our reality? But real ghosts. Ghosts that are really there and we really don't have access to them from our *dimension*. We can only find them mathematically. And like good old movie ghosts, suddenly they show up in a picture after you've decomposed a snapshot of data.
