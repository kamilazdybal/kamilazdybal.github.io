# My journey through learning group theory

One of my postdoc study goals is to learn the basics of group theory (GT) to the point that I will:

1. Apply GT in my machine learning research.
2. Deliver a graduate lecture on GT.
3. Be able to fully understand [G-CNN lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FnQMH2k7jzPrxqdYufoiYVHim8PyZWd) by Erik Bekkers.

This note is a record of my study that I put together mostly to hold myself accountable and monitor my progress, 
but also it might help someone else to follow the same study resources and get a sense of how much time can it take.

### Step 1: Reading [*Visual group theory* by Nathan Carter](https://github.com/liwei766/visual-group-theory/blob/master/visual%20group%20theory.pdf)

### Step 2: Watching [Visual group theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV-9DG53NDxU337smpTwm6sef4x-SCLv)

#### Week 1 (13 May - 19 May, 2024)

- I've read Chapter 1 & finished its exercises.

- I'm in Chapter 2 ...
