# Pasta research

One of my research interests includes studying mechanical and thermo-physical properties of pasta. This research was initiated with my long-time Italian collaborator [Stefano Boccelli](http://boccelliengineering.altervista.org/). After an experimental campaign to determine the Young modulus of spaghetti, our direction shifted towards studying pasta in a more squishy state. In particular, we studied the elongation of a spaghetto and changes in electrical resistance with the time of cooking.

Please contact us if you would like to collaborate on any of these research topics.
