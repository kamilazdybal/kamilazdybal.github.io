# Making effective presentations

After a number of talks that I've given during my PhD, I often receive a feedback from the audience that they enjoyed and understood my talk. At the same time, I often struggle to pay attention to conference talks, even those given by senior academics. That altogether made me reflect on what is it that I'm doing that "works" and what doesn't work for me in some presentations I hear. In this post, I share my workflow of preparing presentation slides, with hopes that our conferences and meetings can start changing for the better, one presentation at a time :)

## Remove distractions

Before adding any results, graphs, etc., your slide should look plain white with nothing on it. There is no need to have decorations, institutional logos, etc. I often find that these act mostly as distractions in getting the message across. Start with a slide that looks like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

## Reduce, or ideally remove, text

There rarely is any need in putting text on your slides. The audience can only pay attention to one thing at a time: either to listening what you're saying, or to reading the text on your slide. By putting text on your slide, you risk loosing the audience's attention. Prepare your speech well and you will not need much text.

The most lengthy text that I ever use on my slides is the slide "topic sentence", which I put at the top of the slide, left-aligned. While introducing the slide, I will often say that topic sentence, either exactly how it appears on the slide, or paraphrasing it. This creates a redundancy of information, to increase the chances that the audience will "get the message".

My last tip here is to create meaningful line breaks when presenting text. A line break like this:

> Projecting high-dimensional data onto lower dimensions
> can introduce non-uniqueness.

reads more naturally than:

> Projecting high-dimensional data onto lower
> dimensions can introduce non-uniqueness.

## Reduce, or ideally remove, equations

As with text, the same goes with equations. For every equation that you decide to put on your slide, ask yourself: what story do I plan to convey with this equation? Will I have time to explain this equations and all its terms? (And if not, there's no reason to include the equation.) Equations that just pop up on the slide for 30 seconds and you never elaborate on are just distractions. Chances are that your audience, instead of listening to what you have to say, will think: why did they include that equation? what do they want me to see in that equation? will I miss something important if I don't understand this equation?

Sometimes, you might decide that adding an equation is worth it, and that's alright. But be sure that you will spend a reasonable amount of time elaborating on the equation during your talk.




## Make your slides very visual...

Oftentimes there's an inspiring and engaging story that you can tell even from one figure. In fact, slides should mostly support you in everything that you can't convey in speech. Show an interesting image or graph is the best way to utilize slides.




## ...but don't overdo it

Too much graphics popping at the audience at once can be overwhelming. Chances are the audience will wonder: what should I pay attention to?




## Remove irrelevant information

I've observed that some academics tend to include detailed information on their slides, as they normally would include in a scientific paper.





## Take-away message

Giving a talk, especially at a conference, is a great opportunity to spread the word about your research or a recently published paper. That does not necessarily mean that you need to include all the information that you would in a scientific paper. In fact, what the audience mostly want is to hear a more accessible and intuitive overview of your work. If you grab their attention, they will look up and read your paper anyway!
